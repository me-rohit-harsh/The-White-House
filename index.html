                        By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on his promise to build an
                        economy
                        that works for working families, including Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander
                        (AA
                        and
                        NHPI) families. The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug costs, health care costs,
                        and
                        energy costs. It’s the most aggressive action we have taken to confront the climate crisis.
                        It’ll
                        lower
                        the deficit and ask the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And no one
                        making
                        under
                        $400,000 per year will pay a penny more in taxes.

                    <p>
                        President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special interests to pass this
                        historic
                        legislation that lowers costs for Americans and their families, advances environmental justice
                        while
                        building a cleaner future, and grows the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.

                    <u><strong>LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS</strong></u>
                    <p>
                        The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will lower health care costs, including prescription drug
                        costs,
                        and
                        expand health insurance coverage for AA and NHPI families.

                        help
                        close the gap in access to medication by improving prescription drug coverage and lowering drug
                        prices
                        in Medicare. The law:

                            $2,000 a year, giving peace of mind to seniors who no longer have to worry about spending
                            thousands
                            and thousands more on prescription drugs.

                    <u><strong>MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER</strong></u>

                    <p>
                        President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ 2017 tax law only made an unfair tax system
                        worse.
                        The
                        Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a critical step forward in making our tax code fairer. It
                        will
                        raise
                        revenue by:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Ensuring that high-income people and large corporations pay the taxes they already owe.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Cracking down on large, profitable corporations that currently get away with paying no
                            federal
                            income tax.

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The legislation’s tax reforms won’t just raise revenue to finance critically needed investments
                        to
                        lower
                        costs and combat climate change, they are also an important component of building an economy
                        that
                        rewards work rather than wealth and doesn’t let the rich and powerful get away with playing by a
                        separate set of rules.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        Millions of working families will have better access to the benefits they are entitled to under
                        the
                        tax
                        code and be able to get their questions answered quickly and efficiently, thanks to the Act’s
                        transformational investments in the Internal Revenue Service. And, no family making less than
                        $400,000
                        per year will see their taxes go up by a single cent.
